 * Reflection (Activity 4 to 5): The lab gets harder and harder but the challenge provided
 * becomes more interesting with every step. I was able to complete the 
 * makeMove method to my satisfaction. I have tested all the test cases but was not able to spend 
 * the time to complete a full games. 
 * 
 * Reflection (Activity 6 to 7): The activity 7 was a bit challenging and I was not able to complete it. I 
 * have added code for activity 6 and I have a very good idea of what needs to be done for activity 7.
 * I did not get time this past few days since I was away at a basketball tournament that
 * I took your permission 2 weeks ago.
